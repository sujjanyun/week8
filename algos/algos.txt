1. BUBBLE SORT!
Write a program to sort an array of numbers in ascending order, comparing and swapping two numbers at a time.
[3, 1, 4, 2]
[1, 3, 4, 2]

Create a function that takes an object
sort the object list
using a .sort method

or
loop through the object and compare each number and swap them if the first is greater than the second


2. CANDIES

add extraCandies to each index of the array and then one at a time, we need to check and see if it made the number greater than or equal to each of the other numbers

if greater > other number = true
else = false

candies = [2,3,5,1,3]
extraCandies = 3
expected output is t, t, t, f, t


3. write a program that return all prime numbers up to a given max
a prime number is only divisible by itself and one

3. PRIME NUMBERS UP TO MAX // FILTER
